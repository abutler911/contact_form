        <h1>About the <br><i><b><u>Stories From The Backseat Project</i></b></u></h1>
        <p>The project started with an idea I had while driving for Lyft and Uber. <br><br>There were many days I would take passengers who would tell me stories about their lives. 
            Some of these stories would be happy stories, some sad, some inspiring and others funny. <br><br>The common theme among all of the stories that I've heard in my time driving people around is that everyone 
            is just trying to do the best they can in this crazy world of ours. 
            <br><br>
            I had an idea. What if I could collect some or all of these stories and compile them for everyone to read. Surely, people would find comfort in knowing that everyone else was doing and dealing with 
            the same things they were.
