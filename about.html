        <h1>About the <br><i><b><u>Stories of Gratitude Project</i></b></u></h1>
        <p>This project was founded on the idea that there is so much negativity in the world these days. Everywhere you turn there is something bad happening, or something 
            negative in the news. We could all use a little more gratitude and positivity in our lives. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The idea is to collect stories from strangers and then post them on Instagram for everyone to see and partake in.</p>
