        <h1>About Stories of Gratitude</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        This project was founded on the idea that there is so much negativity in
        the world these days. Everywhere you turn there is something bad
        happening, or something negative in the news. We could all use a little
        more gratitude and positivity in our lives.
